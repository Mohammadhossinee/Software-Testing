# Software Testing & Program Analysis Project

This project focuses on several key concepts in software testing and program analysis, primarily implemented in Python. The main components analyzed include:

- **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**: Represents the flow of control in a program.

- **Prime Paths**: Identification and extraction of prime paths within the CFG.

- **T-Wise Combinatorial Test Generator**: Generates test cases based on T-wise combinatorial coverage according to input specifications.
